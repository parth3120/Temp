 Method: 
Vary 
o Number of mul paths: 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 
o Number of branches (channels): 1, 2, 3, 5 
Other fixed parameters: 
Graphs 
1. Channel vs Time (SC & MRC) 
o Shows fading amplitude over me for: 
 SC (Selec on Combining) 
 MRC (Maximal Ra o Combining) 
o Nature: 
Fast random varia ons around an average value. More branches (MRC) smooth out 
deep fades. 
2. Probability vs Threshold (M=5) 
o Shows the probability that signal falls below a threshold. 
o Nature: 
 SC: Higher probability of being below threshold. 
 MRC: Lower probability → be er performance. 
3. LCR vs Threshold (Level Crossing Rate) 
o How o en the signal crosses a threshold. 
o Nature: 
 SC: Higher LCR → more rapid fading. 
 MRC: Lower LCR → more stable signal. 
4. ADF vs Threshold (Average Fade Dura on) 
o How long the signal stays below a threshold during fades. 
o Nature: 
 SC: Shorter ADF. 
 MRC: Longer ADF at higher thresholds because deep fades are rarer but last 
longer. 
Which Input Parameters Affect the Graphs and Why 
Input Parameter 
No. of Mul paths 
No. of Branches 
(Channels) 
Sampling Time 
Reason 
More mul paths → more construc ve and destruc ve interference → 
faster, deeper fading. 
More branches → be er diversity → less probability of deep fades 
(improves MRC). 
Smaller sampling me → captures faster varia ons accurately. 
Carrier Frequency (fc) Higher fc → faster Doppler shi s → quicker channel varia ons. 
Velocity (Speed) 
Threshold (dB) 
Avg SNR (dB) 
Higher speed → faster fading → more frequent level crossings (higher LCR). 
Changing threshold changes how o en signal falls below it. 
Higher SNR → generally lower probability of falling below thresholds.
